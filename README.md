## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for sensitive information and configuration. Two files, `.env` and `.env_sample`, are provided:

- `.env_sample` serves as a template with variable descriptions.
- Create a copy of `.env_sample` and name it `.env` to set your environment-specific configuration.
- Fill in the values for each variable in `.env`.
- Keep `.env` secure and add it to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

Never commit the `.env` file to your version control system.
